# JavaScript Essentials

## Introduction
This repository contains essential notes and insights from classroom lectures focusing on JavaScript. The provided day-wise notes aim to cover key concepts and practices to enhance your understanding of JavaScript, a dynamic and loosely-typed scripting language.

## Day 1 - JavaScript Fundamentals (29/01/2024)
- **JavaScript:** Dynamically loosely-typed language for adding functionality to web pages or sites. It is both a scripting and compiling language.
- **Output Engines:** Chakra, V8, JavaScriptCore, Spidermonkey, Firefox, Chromium, Inscript, Jsbin, NativeScript.
- **Basic Definition:** JavaScript facilitates the implementation of complex features on web pages, enabling dynamic content updates, interactive maps, animations, and more.
- **Variable Types:** JavaScript automatically types variables based on the supplied information. Weakly typed examples include JavaScript, PHP, Perl, and C, while strongly typed examples include Python, Ruby, C#, and Java.
- **ECMAScript:** A scripting language specification standardized by W3C, originally released by ECMA in 1997.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Design compatible with previous versions; forward compatibility anticipates compatibility with future versions.
- **Babel:** A JavaScript compiler converting code to older versions, essential for utilizing the latest features while ensuring compatibility.

## Day 2 - Modern JavaScript (30/01/2024)
- **ES6 (EcmaScript 2015):** Introduces 'let' and 'const' as new keywords for variable declaration.
- **Block Scope:** Defined using curly braces ({...}). Functions and variables within blocks are considered block-scoped.
- **Global Scope:** Variables declared outside blocks or functions are global.
- **Scopes:** Global, Block, and Functional scopes.
- **Best Practices:** Avoid using 'var' inside a block; use 'let' and 'const' for block scope to prevent unintended variable overrides.
- **Functional Scope:** Variables declared inside a function are not accessible outside it.
- **Order of Accessibility:** var (functional scope) < let (block scope) < const (block scope).
- **Error Handling:** 'var' in non-strict mode results in undefined values; 'let' and 'const' in strict mode generate ReferenceErrors.
- **Recommendation:** Avoid 'var'; prefer 'let' or 'const'. Prioritize 'const' unless variable reassignment is necessary.

**Note:** Always declare variables with 'let' or 'const' to ensure better code quality and avoid unexpected behaviors.
